## ‚ú® Featured Project: AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite ‚ú®

I invite you to explore my flagship portfolio project, the **AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite**. This detailed AI Solution Architecture showcase demonstrates a conceptual reference architecture for an innovative AI-powered assistant designed to help users optimize their airline loyalty program benefits.

üëâ **Explore the full architecture and documentation here:** [**AI Loyalty Maximizer Suite Repository**](https://github.com/bfisher313/AILoyaltyMaximizer-Architecture)

This project highlights my expertise in:

* üß† **AI Solution Architecture:** Designing robust, scalable, and maintainable AI systems.
* ‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS Cloud Services:** Utilizing a suite of AWS services including Amazon Bedrock (for Generative AI), Neptune (for graph databases), Glue (for ETL), Lambda (for serverless compute), Step Functions (for workflow orchestration), S3 (for data storage), and Textract (for document analysis).
* ü§ñ **LLMs, GraphRAG & External System Integration:** Implementing Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) over knowledge graphs, and leveraging **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for enabling LLM communication with external tools and services.
* üìä **Data Engineering:** Architecting complex data ingestion pipelines and knowledge graph construction.
* ü§ù **Agentic Design:** Conceptualizing agentic systems for proactive and personalized user assistance, where MCP facilitates agent interactions.
* üìê **Expert Architectural Modeling & Documentation:** Proficient in applying diverse modeling techniques (including C4, 4+1 architectural views, and others as appropriate) to create clear architectural blueprints and in-depth documentation, which stands as a key project deliverable.
  
This repository provides an in-depth look at the design considerations, architectural decisions, and technological components involved in building a sophisticated AI-driven platform.
